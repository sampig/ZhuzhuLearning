A List of Java Machine Learning Tools or Libraries
==================================================

1. [Weka](https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/) is a collection of machine learning algorithms for data mining tasks. It contains tools for data preparation, classification, regression, clustering, association rules mining, and visualization. The algorithms can either be applied directly to a dataset or called from your own Java code. Weka provides 2 types of user interfaces: Java Swing and Command Line.
2. [Massive Online Analysis (MOA)](https://moa.cms.waikato.ac.nz/) is a popular open source framework for data stream mining, with a very active growing community (blog). It includes a collection of machine learning algorithms (classification, regression, clustering, outlier detection, concept drift detection and recommender systems) and tools for evaluation. Related to the WEKA project, MOA is also written in Java, while scaling to more demanding problems. MOA performs BIG DATA stream mining in real time, and large scale machine learning. MOA can be extended with new mining algorithms, and new stream generators or evaluation measures.
The goal of MOA is a benchmark framework for running experiments in the data stream mining context by proving: storable settings for data streams (real and synthetic) for repeatable experiments; a set of existing algorithms and measures form the literature for comparison; and an easily extendable framework for new streams, algorithms and evaluation methods.
3. [Deeplearning4j](https://deeplearning4j.org/) is an open-source, distributed, deep learning library for the JVM. It is written in Java and is compatible with any JVM language, such as Scala, Clojure or Kotlin. Deeplearning4j takes advantage of the latest distributed computing frameworks including Apache Spark and Hadoop to accelerate training. On multi-GPUs, it is equal to Caffe in performance.
Its Eclipse Deeplearning4j is the first commercial-grade, open-source, distributed deep-learning library written for Java and Scala. Integrated with Hadoop and Apache Spark, DL4J brings AI to business environments for use on distributed GPUs and CPUs. 
4. [MALLET](http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/) is a Java-based package for statistical natural language processing, document classification, clustering, topic modeling, information extraction, and other machine learning applications to text.
MALLET includes sophisticated tools for document classification: efficient routines for converting text to "features", a wide variety of algorithms (including Na√Øve Bayes, Maximum Entropy, and Decision Trees), and code for evaluating classifier performance using several commonly used metrics.
MALLET also includes tools for sequence tagging for applications such as named-entity extraction from text. Algorithms include Hidden Markov Models, Maximum Entropy Markov Models, and Conditional Random Fields.
The MALLET topic modeling toolkit contains efficient, sampling-based implementations of Latent Dirichlet Allocation, Pachinko Allocation, and Hierarchical LDA.
5. [Environment for Developing KDD-Applications Supported by Index-Structures (ELKI)](https://elki-project.github.io/) is an open source (AGPLv3) data mining software written in Java. The focus of ELKI is research in algorithms, with an emphasis on unsupervised methods in cluster analysis and outlier detection. In order to achieve high performance and scalability, ELKI offers data index structures such as the R*-tree that can provide major performance gains. ELKI is designed to be easy to extend for researchers and students in this domain, and welcomes contributions of additional methods. ELKI aims at providing a large collection of highly parameterizable algorithms, in order to allow easy and fair evaluation and benchmarking of algorithms.
6. [Rapid Miner](https://rapidminer.com/) is a data science software platform that provides an integrated environment for data preparation, machine learning, deep learning, text ming and predictive analytics.
7. [Apache SAMOA (Scalable Advanced Massive Online Analysis)](http://samoa.incubator.apache.org/) is a distributed streaming machine learning (ML) framework that contains a programing abstraction for distributed streaming ML algorithms.
Apache SAMOA enables development of new ML algorithms without directly dealing with the complexity of underlying distributed stream processing engines (DSPEe, such as Apache Storm, Apache Flink, and Apache Samza). Apache SAMOA users can develop distributed streaming ML algorithms once and execute them on multiple DSPEs.
8. [MLlib (Spark)](http://spark.apache.org/mllib/) is Apache Spark's scalable machine learning library. It fits into Spark's APIs and interoperates with NumPy in Python (as of Spark 0.9) and R libraries (as of Spark 1.5). Any Hadoop data source (e.g. HDFS, HBase, or local files) can by used to make it easy to plug into Hadoop workflows.
